    "Hi there! I am Benjamin, and I am a self-taught software developer in Singapore. My journey started when I was 15 and tinkered with game development as a hobby. It was then that I grew to enjoy problem-solving whilst creating systems using programming logic.",
    "",
    "In 2020 I revisited game creation within DotA2 custom games, but eventually decided that the game idea was not feasible within this game engine, and ceased development.",
    "",
    "After discovering Unity. I spent the next 4 months developing the game in Unity from scratch. It led to nothing, but I am proud of how much I learned within that time period.",
    "",
    "In 2022, I decided that I ought to see how far I could go with solving problems in development and programming. I started reading up about software engineering, and I embarked on The Odin Project. With it, I gained knowledge of best practices, web technologies, and projects to practise my knowledge.",
    "",
    "I have been putting in consistent effort almost everyday to pick up skills in front and back-end development, even after work hours. I intend to continue pursuing software engineering, both as a career and through my pet project ideas.",

    "I hope to work with you soon!",
