### Portfolio Site

A personal portfolio for some of the projects I have done so far, both for learning and as pet projects. This site was made with NextJS, TailwindCSS and Framer Motion, and deployed on Vercel [here](https://personal-portfolio-three-iota.vercel.app/).

## Learning Points

- NextJS
- Tailwindcss
- TypeScript
- React HOCs
- Creating React wrapper components to add animation styling, without introducing redundant elements into DOM
- Framer Motion animations and hooks
- Redux with TypeScript
- Responsive web design with Tailwindcss
- Embedding Youtube videos into site.
- Vercel deployment.

## To-do List

- Parallax scrolling background
