### Portfolio Site

A personal portfolio for the little projects I have done so far. This site was made with NextJS, TailwindCSS and Framer Motion.

## Learning Points

- NextJS folder structure
- Tailwind, setting configs
- TypeScript
- React HOC decorator pattern
- Creating React wrapper components to add animation styling, without introducing redundant elements into DOM
- Framer Motion animations
- Redux with TypeScript
